        <h2>Professional</h2>

        <p>I have been working in the tech field most of my adult life.  I have held positions at Verizion, Apple and few start ups. In late 2016 I moved from California to Seattle for my current position at DocuSign.  My current position requires a little coding and API knowledge which led to my motivation to learn programming. Once I complete tracks 201 - 401 at Code Fellows I attend to move into the development department at DocuSign.</p>
